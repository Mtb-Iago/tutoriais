Remove directory from git and local

You could checkout 'master' with both directories;

git rm -r one-of-the-directories // This deletes from filesystem
git commit . -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)

Remove directory from git remoto

As mentioned in the comments, what you usually want to do is remove this directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local)


git rm -r --cached 6PHPOO/MVC/mini-mvc7
git commit -ma "Removção do diretorio mini-mvc7"
git push origin master
